                    <p>
                        Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and long trunks, which they use for a variety of purposes including feeding, drinking, and social interactions. Elephants are herbivores and can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day. They are also known for their strong family ties and often live in matriarchal herds

                    <p>
                            All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

                            Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.
